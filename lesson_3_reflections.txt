When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For one, if you plan on collaborating with anyone else, having a central location accessible by anyone seems like a 
necessity.  Trying to manage distributing the local repository amongst the contributing individuals manually seems 
like excessive effort.

Another situation is if you use more than one computer to do your work.  Being able to have a single place to 
coordinate your changes makes keeping track of things significantly easier.

Then there's the general advantage of having a copy of your work offsite in case something unfortunate happenes to 
your computer.  Never hurts to have a backup.
