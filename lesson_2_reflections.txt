Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Basically, everything I can think of.  This file, for one.  Probably not necessary, but it's good practice, I guess.

I also have a lot of work related items that could benefit from it. 



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and repository is it's not a physical location on the
computer, it's more of a status for files.   Adding and removing files from the staging area doesn't actually affect
the files themselves.  It's useful in that putting something in the staging area allows you to see what your commit is
going to look like before it happens, and lets you make any changes before anything is set in stone.  Also, you can 
add files as you got through the logical change you're making to keep track of what you've done.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If you've made multiple logical changes that are each in separate files, you can stage just the files for a certain 
change, commit, then stage and commit the other item.
